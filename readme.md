## What is Bear in Mind? 

Bear in Mind is a mobile app that helps hikers share reports of wildlife sightings, while also letting them view the reports of others to warn about any potential dangers nearby.

## Inspiration

* Parks and trails typically lack up-to-date notification systems, leaving people unaware of the presence of dangerous animals. With the current infrastructure, park rangers can only communicate with each other, resulting in trail users’ significant dependence on the presence of park rangers to get up-to-date information.
* Especially with more threatening animals like bears, there typically isn’t a very big population in an area because their ranges or territories are large. Thus, a sighting of a bear could mean that users are relatively safer elsewhere.
* We want to help users to feel informed, updated, and safe while exploring new trails. Thus, an animal sighting nearby, or a lack thereof, could help people make a better-informed decision about whether or not to walk a trail.
